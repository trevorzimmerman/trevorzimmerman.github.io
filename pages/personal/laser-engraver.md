# CNC – Arduino / LaserGRBL

This project was a **custom-built laser engraver** controlled by an Arduino Uno with a CNC shield and stepper drivers.  

The engraver interfaced with a PC running **LaserGRBL**, which converted images into G-code toolpaths for the Arduino. <br><br> 
The mechanical frame was assembled with custom parts designed in **SolidWorks** and cut on a waterjet machine, with the full wiring and assembly completed by hand.  

The system was capable of engraving **wood, leather, plastic, and glass** with high precision.
