## Project Summary

This project applies the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to 3D LiDAR data of Lower Manhattan, New York City. The workflow used CloudCompare, Python, and Open3D for preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.

## Demonstration Video

The video shows the LiDAR point clouds in their original form in CloudCompare, then in Open3D before and after DBSCAN clustering.
