# Digital Manufacturing - Siemens Process Simulate

This project used Siemens Tecnomatix Process Simulate to create a factory floor simulation with multiple work cells based on the [Automated Belt Loop Machine](/work/belt-loop-machine) project.<br><br>
I quickly learned to convert SolidWorks assemblies to Solid Edge assemblies and then into a Process Simulate study, integrating pick-and-place operations, machine coordination, and human interactions in a realistic factory setting.

## Final Project Video

The video below showcases the final simulation.
