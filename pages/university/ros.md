# ROS / ROS2 / MoveIt / MoveIt2 / Python / C++

This page demonstrates ROS projects covering simulation, real robot navigation, and manipulation tasks. Highlights include ROSbot, the FRANKA Panda arm, TurtleBot, and the LIMO Robot.

## University ROS Projects

Video compilation demonstrating ROS assignments and projects, including:  
- Turtlesim simulation  
- Husarion ROSbot navigation, wall-following, and obstacle handling  
- Custom two-wheeled robot motion using Python scripts  
- FRANKA Panda arm trajectory planning and execution with MoveIt

## TurtleBot ROS Projects

Completed through **The Construct** using Python with ROS and ROS2:  
- Wall-following using laser scan data  
- Aligning with walls using a custom service  
- Recording odometry during navigation with an action server

## LIMO Robot – Mobile Manipulation

Completed through **The Construct’s Mastering Mobile Manipulation with LIMO-Robot** course using ROS2, C++, and MoveIt2. <br><br> 
This course explored combining navigation and manipulation with the LIMO Robot, covering motion planning, object detection, and pick-and-place tasks.

**LIMO Pick and Place** – The robot detects an object, grasps it, and places it at a new location.

**LIMO Pick, Navigate, and Place** – Extends the previous task with navigation, where the robot transports the object to a distant bin before placing it.

**LIMO Pick, Navigate, and Place Loop** – Demonstrates a looped version of the previous task, where the robot repeatedly retrieves and discards objects in a cycle.
